# IG Publication Bias 
## Project Context
**Immunogenicity Publication Bias and Its Consequences for Predictive Modelling**
This project accompanies the manuscript "_Immunogenicity Publication Bias and Its Consequences for Predictive Modelling: A Call for Transparent Reporting_". It investigates how publication bias â€” particularly the underreporting of early-phase clinical trial data with high immunogenicity â€” skews publicaly available anti-drug antibody (ADA) incidence data. The R-based simulations in this repository reproduce and extend the findings presented in the paper, including ADA incidence modeling and visualizations across Roche-internal and FDA-approved monoclonal antibody (mAb) datasets. One goal of this model is to demonstrate the impact of the publication bias on outcomes of predictive models (see publication for results). Another goal is to promote transparency and improve the reliability of immunogenicity prediction models by providing an openly accessible base model that can be further developed.

## ðŸ“˜ Summary
This project demonstrates the impact of publication bias on the modeling of ADA incidence for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In particular, it compares ADA data from:
- **In-house Roche Phase Iâ€“III studies**, and
- **Published FDA-approved mAb data**,  
to simulate and visualize how ADA-positivity ratios evolve over time under different assumptions about data transparency.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `Publication_Bias_Final.Rmd`: Source R Markdown.
- `data/`: Contains dataset information and related files.
- `figures/`: Contains exported plots.
- `README.md`: This file.

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Simulation of ADA positivity trajectories using a logit-normal model.
- Visualizations of confidence intervals and median trajectories across phases.
- Comparison of ADA dynamics for:
  - Phase I, II, III Roche-internal data
  - FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies
  - Phase-merged in-house simulations
 
## ðŸ§ª Getting Started
1. Clone the repo or download the `.Rmd` file and open in RStudio.
2. Install necessary packages
3. Run the notebook to setup the model and simulations. The public data is provided, and you can use your own data for the "in-house" comparison.
