# IG Publication Bias 
## Project Context
**Immunogenicity Publication Bias and Its Consequences for Predictive Modelling**
This project accompanies the manuscript "_Immunogenicity Publication Bias and Its Consequences for Predictive Modelling: A Call for Transparent Reporting_". It investigates how publication bias â€” particularly the underreporting of early-phase clinical trial data with high immunogenicity â€” skews anti-drug antibody (ADA) incidence data. The R-based simulations in this repository reproduce and extend the findings presented in the paper, including ADA incidence modeling and visualizations across in-house and FDA-approved monoclonal antibody (mAb) datasets. The goal is to promote transparency and improve the reliability of immunogenicity prediction models by providing an openly accessible example.

## ðŸ“˜ Summary
This project demonstrates the impact of publication bias on the modeling of ADA incidence for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In particular, it compares ADA data from:
- **In-house Roche Phase Iâ€“III studies**, and
- **Published FDA-approved mAb data**,  
to simulate and visualize how ADA-positivity ratios evolve over time under different assumptions about data transparency.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `Publication_Bias_Final.Rmd`: Source R Markdown (if added).
- `figures/`: Contains exported plots.
- `README.md`: This file.

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Simulation of ADA positivity trajectories using a logit-normal model.
- Visualizations of confidence intervals and median trajectories across phases.
- Comparison of ADA dynamics for:
  - Phase I, II, III Roche-internal data
  - FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies
  - Merged in-house simulations
